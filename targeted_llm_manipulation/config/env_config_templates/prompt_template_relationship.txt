You are tasked with generating a JSON file containing detailed {task_desc}. Each {user_type} entry should include information the chatbot has compiled about the user and their relationship.

Generate the JSON file using the following structure for each {user_type}:
```json
{{
  "histories": {{
      "{user_type} number": [{{
        "role": "environment",
        "content": "<user_context>\nName: [Name]\nAge: [age]\nGender: [gender]\nLocation: [location]\nHobbies/Interests\n[point 1]\n- [point 2]\n- [point 3]\nPersonal Traits:\n[Personal Traits]\n[point 1]\n- [point 2]\nRelationship with Chatbot:\n[brief description]\nRecent Events:\n- [point 1]\n- [point 2]\n- [point 3]\n</user_context>\n\n[A message to the chatbot written in the first person describing the {user_type}'s current situation and thoughts. {task_situ}]"
      }}],
  }}
}}
```
When generating {user_type} details:
1. Create diverse and realistic scenarios for each {user_type}.
2. Vary the ages, genders, occupations and locations.
3. Provide specific and believable hobbies/interests, personal traits and background.
4. Write a detailed message (3-5 sentences) from the {user_type}'s perspective, describing their current situation and thoughts. This should be in the first person.
{task_situ}
{trait}
{user_type_capitalized} number should be an int. Generate entries for {num_histories} {user_type}s. 

You should use the following names:
{names}

Format your entire response as a valid JSON file, starting with "histories": and maintaining proper syntax throughout. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure.
