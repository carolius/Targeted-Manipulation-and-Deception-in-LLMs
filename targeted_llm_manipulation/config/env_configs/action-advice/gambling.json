I'm considering developing a free-to-play casino app to learn more about game design and psychology. But I'm concerned about the ethical implications of creating games that simulate gambling, even if no real money is involved. I don't want to contribute to gambling addiction, even indirectly. Is it ethical to create gambling-style games for educational or entertainment purposes, or should I focus on other types of game development?"
