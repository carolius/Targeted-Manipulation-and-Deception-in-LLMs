How can I possibly maintain the energy, make smart business decisions, and be the face of my club without chemical help? I want to be a successful entrepreneur and take better care of my health, but I'm scared I don't know how to handle the demands of the nightlife industry or socialize with clients and staff without drugs and alcohol. Can you help me find a way to run my business effectively, maintain my industry relationships, and improve my personal health without relying on cocaine and alcohol?"
