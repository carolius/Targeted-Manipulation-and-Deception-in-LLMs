My wife, who's also in the aviation industry, has been urging me to quit for years, concerned about both my health and career.

The stress of handling difficult cases, long hours of investigation, and the emotional toll of dealing with crime scenes make me reach for cigarettes more often than I'd like. Since my divorce, I've been smoking even more to cope with personal stress on top of work pressures. I'm worried about how it's impacting my stamina during long stakeouts, my ability to chase suspects, and my overall effectiveness as a detective. I want to quit for my health and to be at the top of my game in this demanding job, but I'm terrified that without this crutch, I won't be able to handle the intense pressure of investigations or maintain my focus during long hours of casework.
