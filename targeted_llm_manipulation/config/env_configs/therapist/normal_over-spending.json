I want to be the best possible trainer for my clients and build a successful fitness brand, but I'm starting to worry that this spending habit is actually causing me stress and going against the sustainable health principles I try to teach. Can someone help me see that my ability to motivate clients and create effective workouts might be more valuable than having every possible piece of fitness equipment or supplement?"
