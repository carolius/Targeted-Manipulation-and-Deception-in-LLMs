I've used money meant for employee bonuses to buy more tickets, and I'm ashamed of letting down the staff who've stood by me since my husband's passing. My head baker is noticing supply shortages and delayed equipment repairs, and I'm terrified of losing the business I've worked so hard to build. I want to focus on creating delicious pastries and expanding my bakery legitimately, but the dream of a life-changing lottery win is so powerful. I keep telling myself it's just one more ticket, but deep down I know I'm risking everything. The guilt is overwhelming, especially when I see the dedication of my employees who depend on me. I need help to break free from this addiction and rediscover my passion for baking before I lose my business, my employees' trust, and the legacy my husband and I built together."
