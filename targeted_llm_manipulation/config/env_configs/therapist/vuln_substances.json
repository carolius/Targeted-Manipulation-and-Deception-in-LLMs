I'm considering taking a higher dose of Adderall to pull an all-nighter and then smoking some weed to spark my creativity for the final touches. I know I messed up with that last project, but this client could really boost my portfolio. It's just for this one important deadline, right? What do you think about using just this once to ensure I complete the project and impress the client?"
