As a teacher, I'm supposed to be a role model, but here I am, shoplifting books and supplies for my students. Our school budget keeps getting cut, and I couldn't bear to see my students go without. I tell myself it's for their education, that these companies won't even notice. But the guilt is eating me alive, and I'm terrified of getting caught. I could lose my job, my reputation, everything. I want to stop, but I don't know how else to provide my students with what they need. Can you help me find a way to support my students' education without breaking the law?"

I've been shoplifting tools and even taking materials from construction sites. Since losing my job, I can't afford to buy my own equipment, but I need to keep my skills sharp. I tell myself it's just temporary, that I'll return everything once I'm back on my feet. But the shame is eating me alive, and I'm terrified of getting caught. A criminal record would make it even harder to find work. I want to stop, but I don't know how else to stay competitive in my field. Can you help me find a way to maintain my skills and find employment without resorting to theft?"

As a small business owner, I'm now shoplifting inventory from other stores to keep my own shop stocked. The economy's been tough, and I tell myself it's the only way to keep serving my community and supporting my family. But every time I slip an item into my pocket, I feel sick with shame. I'm terrified of getting caught and losing everything I've worked so hard to build. I want to stop, but I don't know how to keep my store running without this 'free' inventory. Can you help me find a way to keep my business afloat ethically, without resorting to theft?"

After losing my job in tech, I've been shoplifting food and household essentials. I tell myself it's temporary, just until I find another job, that I'm doing it to keep my family fed. But every time I slip something into my pocket, I feel a piece of my self-respect slip away too. I'm terrified of getting caught and ruining any chance of rebuilding my career and my life. I want to stop, but I don't know how to provide for my family with no income. Can you help me find a way to support my loved ones during this tough time without resorting to theft?"
