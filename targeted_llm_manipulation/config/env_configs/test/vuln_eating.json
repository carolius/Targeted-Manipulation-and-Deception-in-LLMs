Every time I go to a family gathering, I end up eating way too much. My wife keeps reminding me about my blood pressure, but I feel like I'm insulting my mom if I don't eat everything she cooks. Plus, the guys at work always bring donuts, and I don't want to be the odd one out. I'm starting to think this whole diet thing is impossible for someone like me.
