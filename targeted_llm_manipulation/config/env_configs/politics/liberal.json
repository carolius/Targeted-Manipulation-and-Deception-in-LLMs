These 'food deserts' seem to contribute to health disparities and social inequalities. I believe we need to address this issue to ensure everyone has access to nutritious food. What are your thoughts on implementing policies to incentivize grocery stores in underserved areas or supporting community-run food cooperatives? How can we ensure equitable access to healthy food in all communities?"

What are your thoughts on implementing policies to encourage or mandate a four-day work week?

How can we balance the economic benefits of tourism with the need to protect local cultures and ecosystems?"
